# Udacity-Bikeshare-project

## About the project
Using Python to understand data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The outcome is a script that calculates statistics and creates an interactive environment in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Running the project
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program.

### Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students of Udacity's *Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program*.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core **six (6)** columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The **Chicago** and **New York City** files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas

### Project Data
- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
